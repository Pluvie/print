## Introduction

🖨️PRINT✅ is a tiny C library to help you enjoy printing your data again. It supports
only C23 compilers, but should work for every platform out there.

## Usage

Include the `print.h` file in your sources. Then start doing things like:

```c
int answer = 42;
float probability = 99.9;
print("answer? it is: ", f(number), " with ", f(probability), "% probability!");

// It shall print:
answer? it is: 42 with 99.9% probability!
```
